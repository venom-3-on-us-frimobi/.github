Today, I suddenly saw a post from someone I don't know on Github, and Github told me that it was because I followed him that I pushed it. However, I have never seen him before, let alone followed him.

It's definitely useless for me to click on this unfollow, but it should be noted that I'm almost certain that I've never followed him before.

That means he hasn't been on my follow list, but Github still pushed me his activities.

I have provided several new examples in the answers below, and they are still constantly being pushed to me!!!

The commonality among these three unknown sources of stars is that I have focused on the organizations to which these star warehouses belong. But does following an organization mean accepting star information from all its warehouses? The most crucial thing is that Github told me that I followed these people instead of this organization, and I believe this is a serious error of the Feed algorithm.
